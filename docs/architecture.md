# Solana Social Media Application Architecture Document

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a social media application based on the Solana blockchain, allowing users to create accounts, publish content, follow other users, and interact with content. The application is developed using Rust, leveraging Solana's high performance and low fee characteristics to implement a decentralized social network platform.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Overall Architecture

The system adopts a client-on-chain program architecture pattern:

- **Client**: Provides a command-line interface allowing users to interact with the Solana network
- **On-chain Program**: Smart contract deployed on the Solana network that handles all business logic
- **On-chain Storage**: Uses Solana accounts to store user data and content data

### 2.2 Module Structure

The project code is organized into the following modules:

- **main.rs**: Client entry point, provides command-line interface
- **lib.rs**: Library entry point, re-exports all modules
- **models.rs**: Defines data models (users, content, etc.)
- **state.rs**: Manages on-chain state and account data
- **program.rs**: Defines program instructions and processing logic
- **error.rs**: Error handling
- **utils.rs**: Utility functions

## 3. Data Models

### 3.1 User Model

```rust
pub struct User {
    pub pubkey: Pubkey,       // User public key
    pub name: String,         // Username
    pub bio: String,          // User bio
    pub followers_count: u64, // Number of followers
    pub following_count: u64, // Number of accounts following
    pub created_at: u64,      // Creation timestamp
    pub updated_at: u64,      // Update timestamp
}
```

### 3.2 Content Model

```rust
pub struct Content {
    pub id: Pubkey,           // Content ID
    pub author: Pubkey,       // Author's public key
    pub text: String,         // Content text
    pub likes_count: u64,     // Number of likes
    pub comments_count: u64,  // Number of comments
    pub created_at: u64,      // Creation timestamp
}
```

## 4. Account Model

The system uses Solana's Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) to store user and content data:

### 4.1 Account Types

The system defines an `AccountState` enum to represent different types of accounts:

```rust
pub enum AccountState {
    Uninitialized,    // Uninitialized state
    User(User),       // User account
    Content(Content), // Content account
}
```

### 4.2 Account Address Derivation

- **User Account**: Derived from the user's public key and program ID
  ```rust
  Pubkey::find_program_address(&[b"user", owner.as_ref()], program_id)
  ```

- **Content Account**: Derived from the author's public key, content seed, and program ID
  ```rust
  Pubkey::find_program_address(&[b"content", author.as_ref(), content_seed], program_id)
  ```

## 5. Instruction Design

The system defines the following instructions:

### 5.1 Instruction Enum

```rust
pub enum SocialInstruction {
    CreateUser { name: String },                  // Create user
    UpdateUser { name: String, bio: String },     // Update user information
    PostContent { text: String },                 // Post content
    LikeContent,                                  // Like content
    FollowUser,                                   // Follow user
}
```

### 5.2 Instruction Processing Flow

1. **Create User**:
   - Validate signer
   - Create user PDA account
   - Initialize user data
   - Save user state

2. **Update User Information**:
   - Validate signer is the account owner
   - Update user data
   - Save updated state

3. **Post Content**:
   - Validate signer
   - Create content PDA account
   - Initialize content data
   - Save content state

4. **Like Content**:
   - Validate signer
   - Update content's like count
   - Save updated state

5. **Follow User**:
   - Validate signer
   - Update follower and following counts
   - Save updated state

## 6. Client Interface

The client provides a command-line interface supporting the following commands:

```
solana_rust [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  create-user    Create new user
  post-content   Post content
  get-user       Get user information
  help           Print help information

Options:
  -u, --url <URL>  Solana cluster URL [default: https://api.devnet.solana.com]
  -h, --help       Print help information
  -V, --version    Print version information
```

## 7. Token Economy Model

### 7.1 Token Utility

The system will introduce a Social Token, used for:

- **Content Rewards**: Users creating quality content receive token rewards
- **Interaction Incentives**: Users receive small token amounts for likes, comments, and other interactions
- **Governance Rights**: Token holders can participate in platform governance decisions
- **Premium Features**: Some advanced features require token payment

### 7.2 Token Allocation

- **Founding Team**: 20%
- **Ecosystem Fund**: 30%
- **Community Rewards**: 50%

### 7.3 Token Issuance Mechanism

- **Initial Issuance**: Fixed total supply, partially locked
- **Inflation Mechanism**: 5% annual inflation rate for content creation and interaction rewards
- **Burn Mechanism**: Portion of feature usage fees will be burned, creating deflationary pressure

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1 Access Control

- Users can only modify their own account information
- Content can only be modified or deleted by the author
- All interactions require signature verification

### 8.2 Data Validation

- All input data undergoes validity verification
- Prevention of overflow and other common vulnerabilities
- Use of Solana's account model ensures data isolation

## 9. Scalability Considerations

### 9.1 Future Features

- **Comment System**: Allow users to comment on content
- **Content Categorization**: Support content tags and categories
- **Private Messaging**: Private communication between users
- **NFT Integration**: Support for NFT creation and trading
- **DAO Governance**: Implement decentralized autonomous organization

### 9.2 Performance Optimization

- Batch transactions to improve throughput
- Optimize account data structures to reduce storage costs
- Implement client-side caching to reduce RPC calls

## 10. Development Roadmap

## 11. Conclusion

This architecture document outlines the design and implementation plan for the Solana social media application. The application leverages Solana blockchain's high performance and low fee characteristics to implement a decentralized social network platform, and incentivizes user participation and contribution through a token economy model.

As the project evolves, the architecture will be adjusted and optimized based on user feedback and technological advancements to provide a better user experience and richer functionality.
